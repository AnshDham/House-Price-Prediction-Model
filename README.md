# House-Price-Prediction-Model
Developed a House Price Prediction Model using Simple Linear Regression to estimate house prices based on their size in square feet. The project involved importing essential libraries such as pandas, numpy, and sklearn, followed by loading and preprocessing the dataset to ensure data quality. The data was then split into training and testing sets to validate the model's performance. Utilizing the LinearRegression() function from sklearn, I trained the model and made predictions. The model's accuracy was evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared, providing a comprehensive assessment of its predictive capabilities.
